# MLFLow hands-on

In this module you will set up MLFlow in already existing Python project.

You will need to read and get a high-level understanding what these Python scripts do.
You do not need to dig deeper in code, but will need to grok the input arguments and files they write.

Navigate to MLFLow_Hands_On.ipynb, the other needed files will be referenced in the notebook.
